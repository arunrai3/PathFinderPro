# Path Finder Pro

Welcome to PathFinderPro, a command-line Python application designed to optimize delivery routes using the nearest neighbor algorithm. This program is tailored for delivery services, providing an efficient and time-sensitive solution for managing package deliveries. PathFinderPro simulates the operation of three delivery trucks, each tasked with distributing packages according to specific criteria outlined in the `packageCSV.csv` file. Users can interact with the program via the command line to track deliveries, view package details, and analyze the efficiency of delivery routes.

## Features

- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:** Utilizes this algorithm to determine the most efficient delivery route, minimizing travel time and distance.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface for running the program and interacting with the delivery data.
- **Multiple Truck Simulation:** Manages three trucks simultaneously to optimize delivery schedules and routes.
- **Time-Sensitive Deliveries:** Considers specific delivery time requirements as per package instructions to prioritize and schedule accordingly.
- **Custom Package Filtering:** Offers the flexibility to view all packages or filter packages by specific criteria such as weight, time delivered, or assigned truck.
- **Detailed Delivery Tracking:** Tracks each packageâ€™s delivery status in real-time, including the exact time of delivery.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates reports on the fly, providing insights into route efficiency, package status, and overall delivery performance.
- **CSV Package Data Integration:** Seamlessly imports package data from `packageCSV.csv`, allowing for easy data management and updates.
